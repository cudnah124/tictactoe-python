## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent
- AI implementations using:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Minimax Algorithm
  - Rule-Based strategies
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI)
- Easy to set up and run

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Techniques to improve AI performance through learning.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: A decision-making algorithm used to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.
- **Rule-Based System**: A set of predefined rules to guide AI decision-making.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cudnah124/tictactoe-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tictactoe-python
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To training the RL Ai, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python ai.py
```

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python gui.py
```

## Gameplay

- The game allows you to choose between playing as 'X' or 'O'.
- The AI will make its move based on the selected strategy (Reinforcement Learning, Minimax, or Rule-Based).
- The objective is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
